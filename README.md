# Simple RAG App

## Overview

This project is a part of my self-development Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to ask questions about the content of a PDF files placed in folder. The app uses techniques to provide accurate answers based on the document's content. The application leverages Ollama, Llama 3-8B, LangChain, and FAISS for its operations.

## Features

- **Ask Questions About PDFs:** Simply place a PDF file in the `data` folder or upload from Web UI and start asking questions about its content.
- **LLM Models:** Utilizes Ollama and Llama 3-8B for generating responses.
- **Efficient Document Retrieval:** Uses LangChain and FAISS for efficient document retrieval and processing (PDF Only).
- **Duplicate Handling:** The app checks the vector database for duplicates and avoids adding them if they already exist.
